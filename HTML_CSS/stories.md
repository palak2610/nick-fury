Thanks for giving me this opportunity. My answers for your queries are -

1. I would like to share my own project which is based on bakery system.
2. I have made this website in march and completed it in a 4-5 days. It is a static website and where 
I have used HTML, CSS and bootstrap. Which make this website responsive. In this website a person can login/signup themselves and can order the bakery items.
I have included About us, Signup and login page. There are other pages also like cake, pastry and many more.
3. My approach of doing this assignment was 
	a) I firstly wrote the file in html and putted all the necessary contents which
	     was needed.
	b) After that I started using css and made pictures and background coordinated
	     to each other
	c) Next I started putting fonts and icons from google fonts and flaticon
	d) Then I added bootstrap to make it responsive.
4.I have been making static websites from 2 years and now I feel that I should use my 
   skill in the industry and get some mentorship in it. My main focus of doing this 
   internship is to learn more things about html/css or front end technologies from experts.

I am attaching my assignment also. It is a zip file so kindly extract it.
Directly open Bervely's Bakery.html and it will take you to my static website
All the webpages are linked with each other
Hope you will like it. Waiting for your response.
